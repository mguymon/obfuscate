# Obfuscate

A simple way to obfuscate ids and text. Useful when you have to make ids visible
to users. Integrates directly with Rails 3.

The goal is to make simple obfuscated ids that are not huge. This is achieved by using an
<a href="https://github.com/otherinbox/crypt">implementation</a> of <a href="http://www.schneier.com/blowfish.html">Blowfish</a> 
and encrypting a single block. This produces a nice id of 11 characters (11 since the 
trailing _=_ is removed by default), for example `3NINgAbOhPc`. The caveat is, the id 
must be within _99,999,999_, e.g. a max length of _8_.

Text can be obfuscated using Blowfish's string encryption as well, but than it produces
output that is larger than the elegant 11 character from single block encryption.

## Install

    gem install obfuscate

## Ruby Usage

A simple example

    Obfuscate.setup do |config|
      config.salt = "A weak salt ..."
      config.mode = :string # defaults to :string
    end

    obfuscated = Obfuscate.obfuscate( "test" )   # "HoDruKtafqyLxZxu9s-kYQ=="
    clarified = Obfuscate.clarify( obfuscated )  # "test"

## Rails Integration

Create an initializer in `config/initializers` with:

    require 'obfuscate/obfuscatable'
    Obfuscate.setup do |config|
      config.salt = "A weak salt ..."
    end

Now add to models that you want to be `Obfuscatable`:

    class Message < ActiveRecord::Base
      obfuscatable # a hash of config overrides can be passed.
    end

To get the 11 character `obfuscated_id`, which uses `mode :block` for the Blowfish single block encryption:

    message = Message.find(1)
    obfuscated = message.obfuscated_id           # "NuwhZTtHnko"
    clarified = message.clarify_id( obfuscated ) # "1"

    Message.find_obfuscated( obfuscated )     # raises an ActiveRecord::RecordNotFound if the found record does not exist
    Message.find_by_obfuscated_id( obfuscated )  # returns nil if the found record does not exist

Or `obfuscate` a block of text, defaults to mode :string which uses Blowfish string encryption, allowing longer
blocks of text to be obfuscated.

    obfuscated = message.obfuscate( "if you use your imagination, this is a long block of text" ) # "GoxjVCCuBQgaLvttm7mXNEN9U6A_xxBjM3CYWBrsWs640PVXmkuypo7S8rBHEv_z1jP3hhFqQzlI9L1s2DTQ6FYZwfop-xlA"
    clarified = message.clarify( obfuscated )
    

## Benchmarks

Some benchmarks from my dev machine, with cpu clocking in at 2.53ghz:

    Obfuscate.setup :salt => 'a very weak salt indead.'

    puts Benchmark.bm { |bm|
      ids = []
      bm.report("obfuscate x1000:") { 
        1000.times { ids << Obfuscate.obfuscate( rand(1...99999999), {:mode => :block} ) }
      }
    
      bm.report("clarify x1000:") {
        ids.each { |id| Obfuscate.clarify( id, {:mode => :block} ) } 
      }
    }
    
    user     system      total        real
    obfuscate x1000: 27.110000   0.000000  27.110000 ( 27.145539)
    clarify x1000: 27.270000   0.000000  27.270000 ( 27.304084)
